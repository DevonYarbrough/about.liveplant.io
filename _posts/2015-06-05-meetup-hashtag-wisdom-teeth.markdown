# Server

@ridhoq and I got the [Vagrant][] box all up and running. Now anyone can clone
down the project and get rolling pretty quickly no matter the platform their
machine runs on.

Go ahead and read the [Vagrant getting started
guide](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html) if you are
unfamiliar with [Vagrant][].

Here is the pull request:
[PR#13](https://github.com/liveplant/liveplant-server/pull/13). [This commit](https://github.com/liveplant/liveplant-server/commit/c4ab28ef5e349b3fbcf8b68709905fa96704916e)
is responsible for implementing the initial [Vagrant][] setup.

Here is the work that still needs to get done: [Issue #15](https://github.com/liveplant/liveplant-server/issues/15)

# Client

Nothing notable to report.
