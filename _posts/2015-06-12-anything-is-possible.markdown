# New Member: Zach Stokes

Zach Stokes (@DeftxPunk) has joined the project! Why is this so exciting? He
has direct experience putting together an IoT hydroponics robot! 

[Check out the kickstarter page for "The Root".](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/57013250/the-root-a-self-contained-solar-powered-plant-grow)

We look forward to see him dropping some knowledge on us and getting the ball
rolling over on [the robot repo](https://github.com/liveplant/liveplant-bot).

# Server Stuff

Took care of some housekeeping on [liveplant server](https://github.com/liveplant/liveplant-server). 

- [Added cors](https://github.com/liveplant/liveplant-server/issues/14)
- [Added support for OPTIONS](https://github.com/liveplant/liveplant-server/issues/14)

# Client
