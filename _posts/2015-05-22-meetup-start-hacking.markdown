Many team members were missing this meetup, so it was rather relaxed. Had the pleasure of adding a new developer to the group and introducing him to Liveplant. 

### Discussions

- Talked about how to gamify liveplant and encourage people to continue coming back. Potential solution is a storyline and chaos events ( need to water the plant so much, defend the plant against ants, plant is going on an adventure, etc ).
- Discussed alternate action voting mechanic: The Leaky Bucket. In order for an action to take place, the action has to receive N votes, with no time limit imposed. Every X period of time, Y votes are drained from the action bucket until it is empty, requiring it to be refilled.
- Discussed overall infrastructure of entire Liveplant project and how all the pieces fit together. ([ChicagoGupta](https://github.com/ChicagoGupta) has a picture somewhere --> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CFvNaR6UEAEfkpw.jpg:large)
