Welcome to liveplant! Here is what you need to know to get started:

### What is liveplant.io?

liveplant.io is a project that was originally started by [Austin][austin],
[Darren][darren], and [Rid][rid] as a [hackdfw][] project a while back. It was
presented at the [Dallas Web & Mobile Development Meetup][meetup-link] as a way for
people of all experience levels to learn more about development. You can learn
more about it's history [here][liveplant-history].

It's divided up into four sub-projects:

- [about.liveplant.io][]: The site you are looking at now!  Jekyll site for
  documenting decisions and progress of the project.
- [liveplant.io][]: The front-end interface. This will be a single-page app that
  has a livefeed of the plant and actions to care for the plant.
- [liveplant-server][]: The API server the client will talk to. It will be
  implemented in [Go][]
- [liveplant-bot][]: A hardware project that will power the bot caring for the
  plant and reporting statistics such
  as humidity, temperature, etc.
