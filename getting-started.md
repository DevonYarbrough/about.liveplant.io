Welcome to liveplant! Here's what you need to know to get started:

### What is liveplant.io?

liveplant.io is a project that was originally started by [Austin][austin],
[Darren][darren], and [Rid][rid] at a [hackdfw][] project a while back. It was
presented at the [Dallas Web & Mobile Development Meetup][rid] as a way for
people of all experience levels to learn more about development. You can learn
more about it's history [here][liveplant-history].

It's divided up into four sub-projects:

- [about.liveplant.io][about.liveplant.io]: The site you're looking at now!
  Jekyll site for documenting decisions and progress of the project.
- [liveplant.io][liveplant.io]: The front-end. This will be a single-page app that
  has a livefeed of the plant and actions to care for the plant.
- [liveplant-server][liveplant-server]: The API server the client will talk to. It will be implemented in [Go][]
- [liveplant-bot][liveplant-bot]: An (insert tbd microcontroller here) project that
  will power the bot caring for the plant and reporting statistics such
  as humidity, temperature, etc.
